simulation of self organized polarized cells using a simple potential model
with spin.
Courtesy of Kim Sneppen
Author: Henrik Pinholt

The code is structured around three sections:
The testfunctions:
    Functions used to test and plot the results of the other blocks of code
The helperfunctions:
    Section containing functions used in the classes that run the simulation
The class definitions:
    Definition of the classes that run the simulation.

The simulation is built around a grid class containing instances of a the
SimpleSpinCell class. The grid runs the simulation by telling each cell
what to do during each timestep. Since the model is based on cell surroundings
the cells update themselves using the appropriate method
